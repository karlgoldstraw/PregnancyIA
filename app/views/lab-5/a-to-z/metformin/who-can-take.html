        Who can and can't take metformin
      </h1>

      <section id="how-and-when-to-take-it">
        <p>It's best to take metformin tablets with a meal to reduce the side effects. Swallow your metformin tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not chew them.</p>
        <p>The maximum daily dose is 2,000mg a day (for example, 4 x 500mg tablets).</p>
        <p>Metformin tablets come in different strengths. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take a day.</p>

        <h3>Different types of metformin</h3>
        <p>Metformin comes as 2 different types of tablet: standard-release tablets and slow-release tablets.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard-release tablets release metformin into your body quickly. You may need to take them several times a day depending on your dose.</li>
          <li>Slow-release tablets dissolve slowly so you do not have to take them as often. One dose is usually enough, and you'll take it with your evening meal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your doctor or pharmacist will explain what type of metformin tablets you're on and how to take them.</p>
        <p>Metformin is also available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets.</p>

        <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
        <p>Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly and may change your dose of metformin if necessary.</p>
        <p>When you first start taking metformin standard-release tablets, you'll be advised to increase the dose slowly. This reduces the chances of getting side effects.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 500mg tablet with or after breakfast for at least 1 week, then</li>
          <li>1 500mg tablet with or after breakfast and your evening meal for at least 1 week, then</li>
          <li>1 500mg tablet with or after breakfast, lunch and your evening meal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you find you cannot tolerate the side effects of standard-release metformin, your doctor may suggest switching to slow-release tablets.</p>

        <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
        <p>If you miss a dose of metformin, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
        <p>If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you.</p>
        <p>You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>

        <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
        <p>An overdose of a large number of metformin tablets can cause serious health problems. The symptoms are severe and quick to appear.</p>
        <p>They include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>stomach pain</li>
          <li>diarrhoea</li>
          <li>fast or shallow breathing</li>
          <li>feeling cold</li>
          <li>unusual sleepiness</li>
          <li>tiredness or weakness</li>
        </ul>
