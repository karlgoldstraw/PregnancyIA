      <a id="overview"></a>
      <p><strong>If you need physiotherapy a number of different options are available to you.</strong></p>
      <p>You can see a physiotherapist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>by getting a referral from a doctor</li>
        <li>by contacting a physiotherapist directly</li>
        <li>at your GP surgery</li>
        <li>privately</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Physiotherapy can also sometimes be accessed through occupational health services, charities, patient groups and the voluntary sector.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <a id="physiotherapy-on-the-NHS"></a>
      <h2>Physiotherapy on the NHS</h2>
      <p>Physiotherapy is available free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK.</p>
      <p>Depending on where you live, you may be able to self-refer (see below) or you may need to visit your GP or consultant first. After discussing your symptoms with your doctor, they may then refer you to a physiotherapist.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">search for physiotherapy services near you</a> to find out where you may be referred to</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a id="self-referral"></a>
      <h2>Self-referral for NHS physiotherapy</h2>
      <p>Some areas in the UK offer a self-referral service, which means you can make an appointment to see an NHS physiotherapist without having to see a doctor first.</p>
      <p>However, this isn't available everywhere. Staff at your GP surgery or <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">your local NHS clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)</a>or hospital trust should be able to tell you whether it's available in your area.</p>
      <p>Self-referral is particularly suitable for people with relatively simple conditions such as <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">joint pain</a>, strains or other injuries.</p>
      <p>If you have more complex needs – for example, you have movement problems caused by a <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">stroke</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">multiple sclerosis (MS)</a> – you may still need a referral from a doctor.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a id="direct-access"></a>
      <h2>Direct access to physiotherapy</h2>
      <p>Some physiotherapists also work in GP practices as the first point of contact for patients with musculoskeletal problems, such as neck or back pain, and those with long-term conditions, such as MS or stroke.</p>
      <p>When contacting your GP surgery, you may be offered to see the physiotherapist directly, instead of having to see the GP first.</p>
      <p>Physiotherapists working in these roles may have advanced skills, such as prescribing and ordering scans.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a id="Private"></a>
      <h2>Private physiotherapy</h2>
      <p>Waiting lists for NHS physiotherapy can be long and some people choose to have private treatment instead. If you see a physiotherapist privately, you'll have to pay for treatment.</p>
      <p>You can usually approach a private physiotherapist directly without a referral from a doctor.</p>
      <p>When choosing a private physiotherapist, make sure they're:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a fully qualified member of a recognised professional body, such as the <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)</a></li>
        <li>registered with the <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find a private chartered physiotherapist near you using CSP's <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">Physio2u directory</a>. You can also use the <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">Find a physio</a> search facility on the Physio First website.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a id="occupational-health-services"></a>
      <h2>Occupational health services</h2>
      <p>Physiotherapy may be available through your workplace.</p>
      <p>Some companies provide occupational health services, which include physiotherapy treatment. Check with your manager or Human Resources department to see if it's available where you work.</p>
