        <h2>Causes of heat rash</h2>
        <p>Heat rash is usually caused by excessive sweating.</p>
        <p>Sweat glands get blocked and the trapped sweat leads to a rash developing a few days later.</p>
        <p>Babies often get it because they cannot control their temperature as well as adults and children can.</p>
