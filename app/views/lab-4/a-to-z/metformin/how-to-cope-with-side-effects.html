        Who can and can't take metformin
      </h1>

        <p><strong>What to do about:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - take metformin with food to reduce the chances of feeling sick. It may also help to slowly increase your dose over several weeks. Ask a pharmacist or your doctor for advice.</li>
          <li><strong>being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea</strong> - drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">dehydration.</a> Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">diarrhoea or vomiting</a> without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.</li>
          <li><strong>stomach pain</strong> - try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your stomach may also help. If you're in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</li>
          <li><strong>loss of appetite</strong> - eat when you'd usually expect to be hungry. If it helps, eat smaller meals more often than usual.</li>
          <li><strong>a metallic taste in the mouth</strong> - if you find that metformin is giving you a metallic taste in the mouth, try chewing sugar-free gum.</li>
        </ul>
