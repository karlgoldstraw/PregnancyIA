      <section id="About-metformin">
        <p>Metformin is a medicine used to treat <a href="/lab-4/a-to-z/diabetes/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a> and to help prevent type 2 diabetes if you're at high risk of developing it.</p>
        <p>Metformin is used when treating <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a>, although it's not officially approved for PCOS.</p>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes is an illness where the body does not make enough insulin, or the insulin that it makes does not work properly. This can cause high blood sugar levels <a href="javascript:void(0);" title="">(hyperglycaemia).</a></p>
        <p>PCOS is a condition that affects how the ovaries work.</p>
        <p>Metformin lowers your blood sugar levels by improving the way your body handles insulin.</p>
        <p>It's usually prescribed for diabetes when diet and exercise alone have not been enough to control your blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>For women with PCOS, metformin lowers insulin and blood sugar levels, and can also stimulate ovulation.</p>
        <p>Metformin is available on prescription as tablets and as a liquid that you drink.</p>
